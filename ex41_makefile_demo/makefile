#How to make a makefile?
#https://youtu.be/_bYFu9mBnr4?t=28485

#the compiled file can be named sth. other than a.out
#in this case I called it 'math'

#destination: source(s)
math: mathstuff.o mathutils.o
	g++ mathstuff.o mathutils.o -o math
#how to get from source(s) to destination

mathstuff.o: mathstuff.cpp
	g++ -c mathstuff.cpp


mathutils.o: mathutils.cpp
	g++ -c mathutils.cpp

#remove any files that need to be cleaned:
#	want to remove any files generated by previous runs of 'make'
#*.o     means any file ending in .o
#math    means the compiled file "math"
clean:
	rm *.o math

#to use this makefile, in the terminal:
#cd ex41_makefile_demo      //cd into folder
#make

#^ that will generate the .o files and link them into compiled file 'math'
#run the compiled file using    ./math
