-fns vs methods
    functions are independent
    methods are part of an object

function
    //function by itself
    do_something()

method
    //attached to an object
    //describes a specific class instance

static method
    //attached to a class
    //describes a class in general

---class vs object---
instance of a class is an object

constructor
    //called when instantiating a class
    //accepts params for class attributes

destructor
    //called when class deleted
    //cleans memory, removes instance of class
