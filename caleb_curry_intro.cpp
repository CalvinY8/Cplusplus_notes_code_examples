/*
what is a compiled language like C++?
gonna have lots of files
computers cannot understand c++ directly,
    only after code 'compiled'
    'linking' is how we get one executable file from many compiled files
    executable is just a fancy name for an application

c++ started 2 popular trends:
Object Oriented Programming
and
Generic Programming
    we can put data in containers,
    and restrict those containers to be certain types
    and that's safer cause we know what type we're working with

compared to modern languages like c# or java,
C++ gives you greater control and optimization, at the cost of less astraction
meaning C++ has more gotchas and is harder to learn

c++ is statically typed, values are attached to types ('compiled') at compile time.

you'll usually see it used in anything computation-heavy
-game engines, modelling software, video editing software
