as you know, classes can inherit from other classes
    base User class might have derived classes 'teacher' and 'student'
    both derived classes inherit things like userID

in polymorphism, all derived classes can be treated broadly as 'users'
    teachers are also users
    so, telling users to get_to_work() will cause
        teachers to go teach
        students to go study
c++ has multiple inheritance
